Ant Standard Edition
========================


1) Installing the Standard Edition
----------------------------------

When it comes to installing the Symfony Standard Edition, you have the
following options.

### Use Composer (*recommended*)



If you don't have Composer yet, download it following the instructions on
http://getcomposer.org/ or just run the following command:

    curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php

Then, use the `create-project` command to generate a new Ant application:

    php composer.phar create-project

Composer will install Ant and all its dependencies under the
`path/to/install` directory.

### Download an Archive File



    php composer.phar install
